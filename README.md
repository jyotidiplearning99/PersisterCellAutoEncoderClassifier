PersisterCellAutoEncoderClassifier is a repository for classifying single-cell RNA sequencing data into different cell types within cancer cells using autoencoder-based deep learning models. 
It includes two main models: PersisterCellNet for identifying persister vs. non-persister cells, and DivisionGroupNet for distinguishing between dividing and non-dividing cell groups.
